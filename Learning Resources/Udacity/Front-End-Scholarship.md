# Google/Udacity Front End Scholarship
This extract is simply going to run through the whole process of the Google/Udacity Scholarship up until the second phase.
It will include my thoughts on the scholarship, the lessons and tips on how to succeed and get picked for the full
scholarship.

## Getting Started - The Application
The application is generally just a overview of you as a person, who you are, what you love and what you want to achieve.
When you have chosen which course you want to complete, then you are required to fill in a short questionaire. 
You are asked to write a piece about why you would want to start the scholarship, why you deserve to do it, and 
what it would mean to you.

At this stage, from memory, I wrote about 750 words on how I came out of programming 10 years ago and regretted it, and this
would be a perfect step to get myself back in to it. You have time to go back and re submit your application up until the
deadline point. 

My suggestion would to just be honest and truthful about your current abilities and where you see yourself being at the end
of the scholarship (if you get that far).

## First Stage - The FEWD Challenge
I remember very well getting the email that I was through to the first round. It was halloween.. I was carving a pumpkin
and I remember my phone vibrating in my pocket. I glanced down and read the email and had to double take! I couldn't believe 
it.. I posted my acceptance email up on Instagram under the tag #googleudacityscholars and celebrated.

Class started not long after that. The section of the scholarship is a run through of material that already exists on Udacity's
catalogue of courses and is split into three projects:

* A PDF - HTML mockup.
* Animal Trading Cards.
* Pixel Art Maker

Each project has supporting videos, each with their own material and exercises to complete that take you right through from
basic HTML, to CSS, to vanilla JavaScript and then JQuery. You are required to submit each of these projects at some
point to a designated thread on the scholarship forum for feedback to be given.

##### Overall Views
Personally, I was impressed with the lessons overall. The basics were taught well, and there was continuously a steady incline
of difficulty, which raised quite drastically when the JavaScript section was reached.
I have programming experience, and I remember getting to the first few exercises and thinking that some people would struggle.
One big flaw at this point was the forum, as when people were getting stuck, they could post their queries and rather than 
be spoken through the process, someone would be in the habit of posting the correct solution up without any explanation
which is a big no no. The forum team did a good job at keeping on top of these "solutions" and covering them all with spoiler
tags, but unfortunately the problem was still apparent.

I have to admit, and I wrote on the forum about this, the JQuery lesson was not great in my opinion. It was rushed,
explained poorly and I got to the end of the course feeling none the wiser about how to implement JQuery into any 
real world code. Thankfully, I managed to get my head around it via other sources, and this lead me up to the 
final project. 

Whilst the first two projects were fairly basic, the Pixel Art Maker was much more in depth, and it was up to the participant
to really work it out for themselves which is a nice approach! Mine took a little over a month to build and I added some
extra features to try and get it to stand out when submitting for feedback. A very good proccess that taught me a lot and
gave me confidence in my own ability. It felt nice to have something that actually works in the browser that you knew
you had built.

#### The Community
One major set back to the process was the fact that it was highlighted that forum activity was to be a deciding factor on
making it through to the next stage. This made for a massively chaotic board of certain folk trying to farm "likes" 
and often the content wasn't as helpful as it could have been.

However, there are a few good elements to factor out. Generally the people were nice and enthusiastic about the course, and 
it is nice that we can follow each others progress through GitHub and various other online platforms. 

There were several community projects which were nice to get involved in, and gave the experience of working in an online 
team which obviously can be beneficial to anyone in their career paths later on.


## Second Stage - The Nanodegree
Although I am not far into the Nanodegree as of yet, I have to comment how great it seems! The list of content is massive,
and I think it was a nice touch to teach React as it is such a massive JS framework at the minute.

The feedback offered on the numerous projects throughout the Nanodegree are massively beneficial.. It goes through your
code with a fine tooth comb and picks out every little detail which could be improved. I learned a lot on my first submission
which was a really basic bit of HTML/CSS. 

The career section is a definite nice touch, and really gives everyone a step in the right direction in terms of boosting
themselves on Github and LinkedIn and beginning to build a portfolio of themselves in their potential new career paths. I
have had a quick look through the "inclusive" job board (just for Nanodegree recipients) and so far although not a lot in
the UK, what is there looks definitely interested and I can't wait to beginning applying to some of these positions
when I successfully complete the course.


# How to Get Picked for the Second Stage!!
This is what everyone wants to see who is currently undergoing the course!! :) Although not an exact science, I can 
definitely give you a view on how to better your chances and get through to the final stage of the scholarship. I have
seen some posts from people on previous years, and I think perhaps some people overthink it.. Here is my suggestions anyways
and hopefully they will work for you!

* Start the course promptly and remain consistent. - I personally feel you have a better chance of success the more you 
show your face around the community. Although I am not saying the course cannot be done in less than the three months given,
you will stand a better chance if you give yourself time to complete the projects to the best of your ability. Consistency 
is the key to this.

* Make yourself known in the community and stay active and helpful. - The forum tracks all of your
posts, post views, likes given and likes recieved. This can then be viewed at any time (by anyone) on your profile. 
I didn't post half as much as some people, I think I finished the course with 200 forum posts, but from those 200 posts
I recieved 989 likes. I kept my content on topic (most of the time) and constantly tried to be as helpful as I could. My
posts were often long and full of suggestions if people needed them and I personally believe this helped me through.

* Finish EVERY question on the courses. - This one is reinstated by the Udacity team numerous times, but it is important! 
Even if you think the content is to easy and you need to skip further ahead, then you need to get the correct answer on EVERY
question. Check and double check.

* Get involved in community projects. - A simple one, but important. We started creating a new CSS framework on our course, and
whilst this isn't a necessary thing to be involved in, it shows willing and determination so give it a go!

* Make your final project stand out. - I am surprised more people didn't do this to be honest! The final project provides
you with a plain HTML/CSS document and you are given the task of making the JS work. The amount of people who didn't go 
the extra step and change the original style or add extra features other than those required was very suprising I must
admit. In fact, the few people I know all got through to the next stage ALL took their project to a new level with at least
a change of CSS. If you have one feature that stands out to the forum mentors then you will stick in their mind.. it is one
of their jobs at the end of the day to recommend those to go through to the final stage. This is possibly the most important
point of all the above!



Hopefully you will find this helpful and take something from it! I will likely do a full Nanodegree review when I am complete
as to buy the course it is a substantial sum of money and it needs to be reviewed!
