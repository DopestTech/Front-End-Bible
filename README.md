# The Front End Bible
The ultimate resource for Front-End developers new and old, this is a repository of tips and tricks with easy to follow guides to get them up and running on your website. We are also going to concentrate on uploading interview advice and a review section of online lessons and courses concerning Web Development.

**However**: This is also a community project aimed at getting those who are not familiar with the workings of Git and version control to practice in a friendly environment. Practice push/pull requests and build your GitHub profile, whilst contributing to an actual project.

### Getting Started
To get started and start browsing through the various snippets of code to add to your project, find the relevant folder above. The names of each file will be relevant for what is inside, and when there is enough files submitted we will create sub-folders _for example: animations, typography, borders etc etc_. 

* To contribute a Tip/Trick - Inside each file, you will find a commented section. This will contain the relevant information on how to implement each snippet of code into your file. If there is any other code necessary it will be included.
* To contribute a Course Review - Go to the relevant section and post your review as a .md file. The title should be the name of the course and the course creator (if known). Give an honest review and a run down of what the course contains. 
* To contribute an Interview Question/Answer - Go to the relevant question and post a new file with the question name as the title as a .md file. Write the question in full and then answer underneath. If you have another answer to a question that has already been created then push a commit to the original file and place your answer underneath the original one.

### Contribute
Every contribution is gratefully recieved no matter how simple or complicated. If this is your first time contributing to a repository, then simply fork the repo and push your commit with a relevant file name. If anything needs changing then I will change to suit. Dont feel embarassed or reluctant if you don't fully understand.. you cant break anything here! :)
